Overview
--------
The Java project includes two programming packages:

1. Examples.feed: 
   Java programs read RSS/Atom feeds from http://www.macleans.ca/multimedia/feed/ and parser these 
   feeds, persist them into Mysql database, and convert into Json feed and output into a file. 
       
   There are four Java classes included: 
       Feed.java --- javaBean; 
       FeedReader.java --- Read and Parser by using ROME framework;
       FeedWriteToDB.java --- persist these feeds into DB by using JDBC with prepared statement; 
       FeedJsonWriter.java --- write feeds into a Json file in data/feeds.json. 
       
   Referenced libraries: ROME(jdom-1.0.jar, rome-1.0.jar); Javax Json (javax.json-1.0.4.jar) 
       
   To run this program, the referenced libraries need to be in Classpath and then execute: 
       java FeedReader                

2. Examples.sac:
   Java program will find the shortest addition chain for any given positive integer N and 
   then calculate the smallest number of multiplications based on the computed addition chain. 
   There are three methods created in this program: 
       the first one is the original binary (search) method --- gen_binary(int nx);
       the second one is the "trinary" method --- gen_trinary(int nx);
       On top of them, a "quadrinary" method created --- gen_quadrinary(int nx).
   These three methods are tested and the results are compared. The results show that both 
   trinary and quadrinary methods will give shortest addition chain or smallest number of 
   multiplication when N < 1087. For very big number N = 31415, three methods will give the results
   as 24, 22, 21, respectively, compared with 19, the smallest number of multiplication.
   However, the computing times are nearly the same for the three methods in the N=31415 case. 
   Therefore, the performance of quadrinary method seems ideal.
